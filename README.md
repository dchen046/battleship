This is a imitation of the game Battleships.

The player is able to place their ships randomly on their board before starting the game.

To start the game, click anywhere on the opponents board.

If an enemy ship has been hit, there will be a red indicator, otherwise there will be a blue indication for all missed shots.

The game will end when all of the ships from either the player or computer opponent have been sunked.
